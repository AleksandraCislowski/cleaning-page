You will then receive a price proposal (fixed price incl. VAT after RUT deduction - check the Swedish Tax Agency's website for what this means). The customer receives the RUT deduction directly on the invoice and thus pays the price shown above after the RUT deduction. ALEKSANDRA CISLOWSKI St√§dfirma administers the RUT deduction directly with the Swedish Tax Agency. If the RUT deduction is not approved by the Swedish Tax Agency, the customer will be charged for the full amount."
